                    <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
                    <p>It is W3 Applications Inc.'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
                        collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a
                            href="https://w3applications.com">https://w3applications.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we",
                        or "https://w3applications.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
                        personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this
                        privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website,
                        how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to
                        third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website
                        and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the
                        general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when
                        visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                    <p>Like most website operators, W3 Applications Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information
                        of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
                        language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. W3
                        Applications Inc.'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
                        understand how W3 Applications Inc.'s visitors use its website. From time to time, W3
                        Applications Inc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
                        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                    <p>W3 Applications Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
                        Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on
                        https://w3applications.com blog posts. W3 Applications Inc. only discloses logged in user and
                        commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
                        personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

                    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                    <p>Certain visitors to W3 Applications Inc.'s websites choose to interact with W3 Applications Inc.
                        in ways that require W3 Applications Inc. to gather personally-identifying information. The
                        amount and type of information that W3 Applications Inc. gathers depends on the nature of the
                        interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://w3applications.com
                        to provide a username and email address.</p>

                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive
                        to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee
                        its absolute security.</p>

                    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
                    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set
                        cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an
                        online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
                        information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
                        believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by W3
                        Applications Inc. and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>


                    <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
                    <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a
                        third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
                        review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
                    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
                        practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>



                    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                    <p>W3 Applications Inc. may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. W3
                        Applications Inc. may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, W3
                        Applications Inc. does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>


                    <h2>Cookies</h2>

                        technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate
                        advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
                    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the

                        who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
                        cookies before using W3 Applications Inc.'s websites, with the drawback that certain features of
                        W3 Applications Inc.'s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

                        continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
